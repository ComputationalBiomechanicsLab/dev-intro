1) (Emotional/psychological) Quickly make it clear that uploading code to GitHub isn't a big deal.
    a) loads of researchers in Cambridge, at least, usually avoided code sharing because they were embarrassed about their code
    b) first minute or two should maybe point out that almost all code is buggy, and starts out hacky
    c) but a flawed codebase today usually trumps a perfect codebase never
    d) maybe I could find some particularly horrible snippets from my account's repos as examples of terrible stuff

2) Extremely basic end-to-end upload (assume Windows and minimal CLI knowledge):
    a) install dependencies (something easy like TortoiseGit?)
    b) make local repo
    c) write Matlab/Python script oneliner
    d) add + commit locally
    e) quickly show that even doing this much enables rewinding work, etc.
    f) make GitHub account (or just login)
    g) make GH repo
    h) upload local repo to GitHub
    i) show it in GitHub GUI
    j) pretend to send a link, or demonstrate why it's useful for sharing

3) (bonus) demonstrate PRing some other repository
    a) this might be a place to introduce the CBL github organization
    b) the tutorial notes could be in a repo like ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/git-tutorial
    c) as a summary, I clone that repo and fix (e.g.) a typo in a tutorial step (or something)
    d) which shows where the notes are online *and* CBL's page *and* PRing
